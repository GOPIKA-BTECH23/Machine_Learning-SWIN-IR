## SwinIR-Like Super-Resolution on DIV2K Dataset
ðŸ›  Team Project Overview
We are a team of 4 who collaborated to build and train advanced Image Restoration (IR) models.
Our focus was on enhancing image resolution using state-of-the-art Transformer and GAN-based architectures.
Additionally, we have written a research paper detailing our work and the results we achieved with SwinIR and Real-ESRGAN models. The paper discusses the methodology, experimental setup, and findings from the training on the DIV2K and Flickr2K datasets.

## Models We Worked On:
SwinIR (Transformer-based model for image super-resolution)
Real-ESRGAN (GAN-based model for practical image restoration)

## Datasets Used:
DIV2K (2K high-resolution images)
Flickr2K (high-resolution Flickr images)

## About This Project
This project implements a simplified version of the SwinIR (Swin Transformer for Image Restoration) model for single-image super-resolution (SISR). The model is trained on the DIV2K dataset and evaluated using PSNR and SSIM metrics.

## Features
Uses PyTorch for model development and training
Simplified SwinIR-style CNN architecture (not full Swin Transformer)
DIV2K dataset loader with random patch extraction and downscaling
Image super-resolution with upscaling factor 4Ã—
PSNR and SSIM evaluation metrics
Visualization of low-res, super-res, and high-res images

Requirements

Install the dependencies using pip:

pip install numpy opencv-python torch torchvision matplotlib tqdm scikit-image
Install Dataset

## Download the DIV2K dataset (HR images):
Training: DIV2K_train_HR
Validation: DIV2K_valid_HR

## Training
python swinir_sr.py
Evaluation
PSNR: 21.30 dB
SSIM: 0.5194

## Visualization
The script includes a function to visualize:
Low-resolution input
Super-resolved output
Ground-truth high-resolution image

## Model Overview
The architecture is inspired by SwinIR but implemented as a simple CNN:
Convolutional feature extractor
Residual-like layers with batch norm and ReLU
PixelShuffle-based upsampling

** Notes
Only the HR images are used (LR images are generated on-the-fly via downscaling).
The model uses L1 loss.
Training can be further improved with more epochs and a deeper architecture.
